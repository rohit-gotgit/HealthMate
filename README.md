## 🧠 System Approach

HealthMate uses a hybrid intelligence model:

▸ Rule based symptom decision trees  
▸ GPT assisted contextual reasoning  
▸ Structured prompt pipelines  
▸ Safety constrained output formatting  
▸ Location based medical resource lookup  

This ensures responses remain helpful, fast, and controlled instead of freeform unsafe generation.
